# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience

This project is part of the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage. It focuses on gaining insights from customer reviews and predicting customer booking behavior using real-world data science techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Web Scraping for Customer Sentiment Insights**  
   Scrapes and analyzes customer reviews of British Airways to identify common sentiment trends and themes.

2. **Predicting Customer Buying Behavior**  
   Builds machine learning models to predict whether a customer will complete a booking, based on user interaction data.
